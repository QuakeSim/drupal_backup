- implement directionality properly
- figure out what to do with relations that are too big to load.

- Field API creation and editing?
  - display with natural language formatters..

- The relation module should be able to ask the relation bundle provider things
  like:
  - what is your subject type + predicate + object type?
  - what relations of your type exist, given a set of subject or object ids?
    -> what relations of your type exist for subject id *?
    -> what relations of your type exist for object id (123, 456, 78, 9)?

- We will be able to ask relations' relation API about what relations exist,
  like "given entity type X, find all relation bundles where X is the subject
  (or object, or either)".

- The relation API will find the shortest path between entities:
  - get_relation('subject_type', 'object_type')
  - get_relation(user, node)  ~~~> user --> node
  - get_relation(user, term) ~~~> user --> node --> term
  - get_relation(user, file, term) ~~~> user --> file --> node --> term
