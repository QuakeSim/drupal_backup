Description
===========
This module allows you to insert tokens into a textarea. It supports both plain text and wysiwyg textareas. The format used for the insert is compatible with Token filter.

This module contains three modules:

- Token insert UI: Allows you to select which tokens are available for the insert, by default all tokens are shown. This module doesn't have to be enabled to use the others.
- Token insert (text): Add a fieldset under each textarea, works for both plain text fields and wysiwyg fields.
- Token insert (wysiwyg): Adds an extra button to wysiwyg editors and opens a popup to select the token to insert.
